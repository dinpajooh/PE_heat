This directory contains the input files necessary to run the 
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations for molecular junctions
consisting of Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, and Pt metal leads and polyethylene polymer chains.

Each directory of elements consists of the directories named d_x, 
where x is the electrode distance. 

In each d_x directory, the input files and running scripts (RUN.pbs) can be found.



RUNING SIMULATIONS
################################

If you want to run the molecular dynamics simulations simply run:

1- lammps < in.PEequil > Outequil

2- mv FINALCONFIG RESTART

3- lammps < in.PEprod > Outprod

where lammps is the executable of the LAMMMPS software program. Note that we use the version of LAMMPS released on March 16, 2018.
